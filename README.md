Got it! Since you don't have a separate evaluation file and you're using a Jupyter Notebook (`microsoft_malware (1).ipynb`), I’ll adjust the README accordingly. Here’s a revised version with the details filled in based on what you've shared:

# Microsoft Malware Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the likelihood of malware on a system using machine learning models. The dataset used is from the **Microsoft Malware Prediction** competition on Kaggle, which contains various features about system configurations and software. The goal is to identify potential malware by building a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **XGBoost** (Gradient boosting model)
- **Random Forest** (Ensemble learning)
- **Logistic Regression** (Classification model)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **MLflow** (Model tracking and logging)

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Irrelevant columns such as `MachineIdentifier`, `ProductName`, and `CountryIdentifier` were dropped to focus on the features relevant for prediction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Log transformations were applied to skewed features to reduce their bias. Missing values were handled using appropriate imputation strategies.
- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features were scaled for consistency in model input.

## Models Used
- **XGBoost**: This model was chosen for its high performance in classification tasks, especially with imbalanced datasets like malware prediction.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline classification model to compare with more complex models.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly predicted labels.
- **Precision**: The percentage of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
- **Recall**: The percentage of true positive predictions out of all actual positives in the dataset.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **AUC-ROC**: The area under the ROC curve, a measure of the model’s ability to distinguish between classes (malware vs. non-malware).

## Installation
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing & Model Training**:
   Run the Jupyter notebook `microsoft_malware (1).ipynb` to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate them.

   To open the notebook, you can use:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook microsoft_malware\ (1).ipynb
   ```

   Inside the notebook, the following steps are covered:
   - **Data loading and cleaning**.
   - **Model training**: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
   - **Model evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

2. **Logging Results with MLflow**:
   MLflow is used to track the models and experiments. The results are logged automatically in the notebook, and you can view them in the MLflow UI.
